x3mlEditor
==========

x3mlEditor is a web application used to edit/view [x3ml](https://github.com/delving/x3ml "x3ml") mapping files stored in an [eXist] (http://www.exist-db.org "eXist") database (Has been tested with eXist versions 1.4-1.4.3)..

## Build - Deploy - Run
Folders src, web and lib contain all the files needed to build the web app and create a war file.
You may use any application server that supports war files. (Has been tested with Apache Tomcat versions 5,6,7).

## eXist setup 
Once you have an eXist database instance up and running, you may use an example database setup (such as the one in [3M_configuration_files] (https://github.com/isl/Mapping-Memory-Manager/tree/master/3M_configuration_files "3M_configuration_files")) to begin with. Download [3M_configuration_files] (https://github.com/isl/Mapping-Memory-Manager/tree/master/3M_configuration_files "3M_configuration_files") and store [DMSCollection] (https://github.com/isl/Mapping-Memory-Manager/tree/master/3M_configuration_files/DMSCOLLECTION "rootCollection") into eXist's collection db.

## Configuration
Once you have deployed the x3mlEditor war and you have stored files from [3M_configuration_files] (https://github.com/isl/Mapping-Memory-Manager/tree/master/3M_configuration_files "3M_configuration_files") into your eXist DB, you should check x3mlEditor's web.xml and make any necessary adjustments (Mostly IPs, ports and filepaths). There is a description tag for every parameter, explaining what may be changed and what should be left untouched.

## Usage
x3mlEditor's default usage is as a [3M] (https://github.com/isl/Mapping-Memory-Manager "3M") plugin.
It may also be used independently, but new mapping files should be created and deleted either manually or using some other software.

[x3ml](https://github.com/delving/x3ml "x3ml") mapping files are stored inside eXist's Mapping collection (subcollection 1,2,3 and so on...). 

If you want to edit a mapping file, use:
**http://(server IP):(server port)>/x3mlEditor/Index?id=(Mapping id found in admin part)** 
e.g. **http://localhost:8080/x3mlEditor/Index?id=6**

If you want to simply view a mapping file, add parameter action with value view:
**http://(server IP):(server port)>/x3mlEditor/Index?id=(Mapping id found in admin part)&action=view** 
e.g. **http://localhost:8080/x3mlEditor/Index?id=6&action=view**

If you want to view a mapping file as raw XML, add parameter output with value xml:
**http://(server IP):(server port)>/x3mlEditor/Index?id=(Mapping id found in admin part)&output=xml** 
e.g. **http://localhost:8080/x3mlEditor/Index?id=6&output=xml**
