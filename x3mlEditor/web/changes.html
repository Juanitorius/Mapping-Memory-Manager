        <p>20/05/2014: Nasty bug that prevented attributes (@version, @type, @variable etc)
            from being updated is now fixed! Adding maintenance card.</p>
        <p>16/05/2014: Combo-filling code redesigned to reduce queries needed and also
            show entities/properties inside their actual group (fixing E-D-L mixup)</p>
        <p>14/05/2014: Making xsl compliant with latest xsd (instance_info block).</p>

            according to Martin's wishes.</p>
        <p>10/04/2014: Migration to new schema (x3ml) complete! Needs testing to discover what I' ve missed.
            In the meantime, optimization!</p>
        <p>01/04/2014: New xsd: Major changes!</p>
        <p>11/03/2014: Now there are 3 mechanisms to fill combos! Have to choose which one to use.</p>
        <p>14/02/2014: More visual changes to save space.</p>
        <p>13/02/2014: Fixed bug concerning rdf_link. Hiding help for now. Will replace with tooltip at a later
            stage. Trying to support subproperty (heavy!)</p>
        <p>11/02/2014: if-rule with operator ready! Changed the way subclasses and superclasses are calculated 
            (Now querying all files at the same time! Needs testing.) Clone mappings-links available.

        <p>31/01/2014: Fixing combos (keep selected, add empty option). Changed queries to get combo values 
            (operator "=" changed to "ends-with", so that I also get results in full URL format). Target schemas may
            also be rdf files (So far I only accepted rdfs).</p>
        <p>30/01/2014: All icons are small now. Meeting with Martin, several remarks. First of all,
            getting rid of empty spaces.</p>

        </p>
