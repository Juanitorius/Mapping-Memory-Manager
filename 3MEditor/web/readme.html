    <h5 style="text-decoration: underline;">August</h5>
    <p>24 August 2015: Visual changes following Korina's suggestions doc.</p>
    <p>13 August 2015: Updated source analyzer functionality. Now domain source value is taken into account when user fills link source values. 
        This way user gets only meaningful possible values inside combo and not all of them!
    </p>
    <p>11 August 2015: Added label_generator functionality. Made further progress with nasty issue 30 (need to test all cases though).</p>
    <p>06 August 2015: Apparently fixing jira issue 30 broke down deleting maps and links. Applied a new fix but it requires further testing.</p>

    <h5 style="text-decoration: underline;">July</h5>
    <p>08 July 2015: Fixing jira issue 30: Html tree was not updated when you deleted a link or a map if what you deleted had following
        siblings.</p>

    <h5 style="text-decoration: underline;">June</h5>
    <p>26 June 2015: Changed default transformation output from n-triples to rdf/xml and also added a button
        so that user may choose desired output. Fixed 201 mapping bug (CRMsci using cidoc with absolute paths did not
        return all values)</p>
    <p>25 June 2015: Complete redesign of if-rule column to support richer expressions (will need testing).
        Copied @type hack from x3mlEditor to support older x3ml files.
        Added instance_generator functionality inside additional/entity</p>

    <h5 style="text-decoration: underline;">May</h5>
    <p>29 May 2015: Bug fixing and cosmetics (based on notes after demo in Î“100).</p>

    <p>25 May 2015: Added graph tab (work by Nikos). Will need feedback.</p>

    <p>14 May 2015: Partial XML source edit functionality added! Transformation tab: User can now edit source file on the fly!</p>
    <p>7 May 2015: Added Tranformation tab, so that user may view x3ml Engine results with a user interface.</p>
    <p>4 May 2015: Showing partial XML source views. First step towards adding edit Raw XML functionality.</p>

    <h5 style="text-decoration: underline;">April</h5>
    <p>22 Apr 2015: Removing xpaths from title attibutes.</p>
    <p>21 Apr 2015: Restored variable in intermediate entity once again. Fixing borders issues when trying to delete. Changing configuration layout.</p>
    <p>20 Apr 2015: Fixing empty target schema bug. Adding a custom value even when source analyzer is on is now possible (Still needs some further refining...).
        Adding narrower support in if-rule. When deleting last condition inside if-rule OR block, also delete entire if block to help x3ml Engine.
    </p>
    <p>17 Apr 2015: Visuals and bug fixing.
    </p>
    <p>16 Apr 2015: One more set of visual changes.
    </p>
    <p>08 Apr 2015: Multiple visual changes (Korina's doc ~ 90%).
    </p>
    <p>03 Apr 2015: Changed whole upload mechanism. Now checking for duplicates and if found file is not uploaded and is replaced by its
        duplicate. Also added better exception handling for schema queries and possible target-namespace mismatch. Changed source analyzer service.</p>
    <p>02 Apr 2015: At last added listener code that removes any unused or duplicate files from server and DB on sessionDestroyed.
        Added message if source analyzer cannot read source schema or example xml (some mappings had rdf files with extension .xml as source
        schema, for example Mapping2). Scroll editable block to top of page so that user does not get lost.
    </p>
    <h5 style="text-decoration: underline;">March</h5>
    <p>27 Mar 2015: Added source analyzer functionality! Works with xml files at the moment.
        Needs extra work for xsd. Also changed combo filling mechanism to reduce server requests and
        provide a primitive target validator.</p>
    <p>23 Mar 2015: Added instance_generation mode. Added about tab to keep track of changes.
        Fixed a nasty, hard to detect bug (when deleting one of multiple entries and shifting positions, input values were 
        lost! XML was fine, so when user refreshed page, everything was fine.)
    </p>
    <p>18 Mar 2015: Changed placeholder text and appearance. Fixed a copy-paste bug.
        Added text in configuration tab.</p>
    <p>17 Mar 2015: Moving action column to dummy header row!</p>

        Removed actions label to save space.
    </p>
    <p>2 Mar 2015: Fixed proper view mode. Made relationships italics.
        Changed how additional relationship combo is filled. Fixing bug with if-rule in domain.
